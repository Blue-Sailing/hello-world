learning GitHub

Hey Guys!

I am just a beginner taking some online classes in Python. To help me learn the language I started playing with some of my own very very simple projects. That is where I began an interest in GitHub.

I would like to have my project codes looked at by others in hopes of helping me do things better and learn more.

Here we go!
